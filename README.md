Created this application for Skdimore Codes club. Never was deployed or actually used for the club and so some features are no longer in use. For example, this fetches a JSON file from a specific AWS S3 location but the file no longer exists. So many pages will display blank. This also includes the moving info bar. To run the application follow the following:
